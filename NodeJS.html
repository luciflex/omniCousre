        From the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to
        reinforce
        what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your
        own
        project once you’re done.

        You’ll be building four projects:<br>

        1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet<br>

        2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs<br>

        3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication<br>

        4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion<br>

        By the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.<br>
        <h3 class="fourth">Who this course is for: </h3>

                A Full-stack Developer & Teacher<br><br>

                I'm Andrew, a full-stack developer living in beautiful Philadelphia!<br>

                I launched my first Udemy course in 2014 and had a blast teaching and helping others. Since then, I've
                launched 3
                courses with over 110,000 students and over 18,000 5-star reviews.

                I currently teach JavaScript, React, and Node.<br><br>

                Before I ever heard about Udemy or thought about teaching, I created a web app development company. I've
                helped
                companies of all sizes launch production web applications to their customers. I've had the honor of
                working with awesome
                companies like Siemens, Mixergy, and Parkloco.<br>

                I have a Computer Science degree from Temple University, and I've been programming for just over a
                decade. I love
                creating, programming, launching, learning, teaching, and biking.<br><br>

                I can't wait to see you inside one of my courses!
