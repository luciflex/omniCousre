        Here is what you will get with this course:<br><br>

        <b>1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills</b>– Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In
        fact, we
        code
        together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you
        can
        follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.<br><br>

        <b>2. Code templates</b>– Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates for every AI you build in the
        course.
        This makes
        building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the
        potential is
        unlimited.<br><br>

        <b>3. Intuition Tutorials</b> – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way,
        we
        believe in
        developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t
        throw
        complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in coding AI making for infinitely better
        results
        down the line.<br><br>

        <b>4. Real-world solutions</b> – You’ll achieve your goal in not only 1 game but in 3. Each module is comprised
        of
        varying
        structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real
        life,
        rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make
        perfect.<br><br>

        <b>5. In-course support</b> – We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI
        course on
        the
        planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of
        professional Data
        Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.
