		You can launch a new career in web development today by learning HTML & CSS. You don't need a computer science
		degree or expensive software. All you need is a computer, a bit of time, a lot of determination, and a teacher
		you trust. I've taught HTML and CSS to countless coworkers and held training sessions for fortune 100 companies.
		I am that teacher you can trust.

		Don't limit yourself by creating websites with some cheesy “site-builder" tool. This course teaches you how to
		take 100% control over your webpages by using the same concepts that every professional website is created with.

		This course does not assume any prior experience. We start at square one and learn together bit by bit. By the
		end of the course you will have created (by hand) a website that looks great on phones, tablets, laptops, and
		desktops alike.
		<h3 class="fourth">Who this course is for: </h3>
		<ul>
			<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Anyone who wants to build websites the "professional" way</i><br><br>
			<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Anyone who has practiced web design as a hobby but is not confident about
				their skillset in a
				professional arena</i><br><br>
			<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Experienced developers looking to renew their HTML5 & CSS3
				knowledge</i><br><br>

				Hi, I'm Brad and I’ve taught web development to countless coworkers and held training sessions for
				fortune 100 companies.<br><br>

				I also teach local night classes and run a somewhat popular YouTube channel named LearnWebCode.
				<br><br>
				I’m a front-end developer, designer, and educator. I’ve been building user interfaces for over a decade
				for the world's largest brands, international technology leaders, and national political
				campaigns.<br><br>

				I'm fortunate to enjoy the development work I do, but my true passion is helping people learn.
